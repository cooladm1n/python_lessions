# Lesson 07: Exceptions and Robust Error Handling

In this lesson you will learn:
- Raising and catching exceptions
- `try/except/else/finally`
- Creating helpful error messages and custom exception types
- Input validation and fail-fast philosophy
- EAFP vs LBYL (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission)

Exercises:
1) Write a function `safe_div(a, b)` that handles division by zero.
2) Parse integers from strings and report invalid inputs.
3) Use `finally` to ensure files or connections are closed.
4) Design a custom exception `NegativeAmountError` and use it in a bank app.
5) Demonstrate EAFP: attempt then handle, vs LBYL: check then act.
