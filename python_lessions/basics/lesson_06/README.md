# Lesson 06: Strings and File I/O (with Context Managers)

In this lesson you will learn:
- String methods: `split`, `join`, `strip`, `replace`, `startswith`, `in`
- f-strings and formatting specifiers
- Reading/writing text files safely with `with`
- Path handling with `pathlib`
- Newline and encoding basics

Exercises:
1) Write text to a file and read it back.
2) Count lines, words, and characters in a file (like `wc`).
3) Replace all occurrences of a word and save to a new file.
4) Parse CSV-like lines (comma-separated) into lists and join them.
5) Build a simple log file with timestamped messages.
6) Demonstrate handling of UTF-8 characters both reading and writing.
