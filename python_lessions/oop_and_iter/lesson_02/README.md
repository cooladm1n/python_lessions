# Lesson 10: Iterators, Generators, and Context Managers

In this lesson you will learn:
- Building iterators and generators with `yield`
- Generator expressions and laziness for large data
- `itertools` helpers: `count`, `islice`, `chain`, `groupby`
- Custom context managers with `contextlib`
- Resource management patterns and timing utilities

Exercises:
1) Write a generator that yields Fibonacci numbers up to a max.
2) Build a context manager that times a code block.
3) Convert a list-processing function to a generator pipeline.
4) Use `itertools.islice` to take the first N values from an infinite generator.
5) Chain multiple iterables and group items with `groupby`.
