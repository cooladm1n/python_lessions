# Lesson 12: Testing, Type Checking, and Best Practices

In this lesson you will learn:
- Writing tests with `unittest` or `pytest`
- Static types with `mypy` and disciplined typing
- Clean code, docstrings, and formatting (black, isort, flake8)
- Dependency management and project layout
- Test structure: AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert), parametrization, fixtures

Exercises:
1) Write unit tests for a pure function from an earlier lesson.
2) Add type hints and run a static type checker.
3) Format code and fix lints; discuss tradeoffs and readability.
4) Add a simple CI checklist: run tests, lint, type-check.
5) Use property-based testing (e.g., Hypothesis) for a small function.
